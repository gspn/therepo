    About
    =============
    Portal™ is a new single player game from Valve. Set in the
    mysterious Aperture Science Laboratories, Portal has been
    called one of the most innovative new games on the horizon
    and will offer gamers hours of unique gameplay.
    
    The game is designed to change the way players approach,
    manipulate, and surmise the possibilities in a given
    environment; similar to how Half-Life® 2's Gravity Gun
    innovated new ways to leverage an object in any given
    situation.
    
    Players must solve physical puzzles and challenges by
    opening portals to maneuvering objects, and themselves,
    through space.
